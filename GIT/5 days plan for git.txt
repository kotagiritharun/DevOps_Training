Day 1: Introduction to Git

1. Familiarize yourself with Git basics:
   - Understand the purpose of version control and Git's role in it.
   - Learn about the fundamental concepts of Git, such as repositories, commits, branches, and remotes.

2. Install Git:
   - Download and install Git on your computer from the official website (https://git-scm.com/).

3. Configure Git:
   - Set up your name and email address using the following commands:
     ```
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
     ```

4. Create a local repository:
   - Create a new directory on your computer for your project.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and initialize a new Git repository using the command:
     ```
     git init
     ```

5. Add and commit files:
   - Create some files or copy an existing project into your repository.
   - Use the following commands to stage and commit your changes:
     ```
     git add <file1> <file2> ...     # Stage specific files
     git add .                       # Stage all files
     git commit -m "Initial commit"   # Commit changes with a descriptive message
     ```

Day 2: Branching and Merging

1. Create and switch branches:
   - Learn about the importance of branches in Git for isolating changes and parallel development.
   - Create a new branch using the command:
     ```
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
   - Switch to the newly created branch:
     ```
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```

2. Make changes in a branch:
   - Switch to the branch where you want to make changes.
   - Modify existing files or create new ones.

3. Merge branches:
   - Switch back to the main branch:
     ```
     git checkout main
     ```
   - Merge your branch into the main branch:
     ```
     git merge <branch-name>
     ```
   - Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the merge process.

Day 3: Collaboration with Remotes

1. Set up a remote repository:
   - Create a repository on a Git hosting service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
   - Link your local repository to the remote repository using the command:
     ```
     git remote add origin <remote-url>
     ```

2. Push and pull changes:
   - Push your local commits to the remote repository:
     ```
     git push origin <branch-name>
     ```
   - Pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository:
     ```
     git pull origin <branch-name>
     ```

3. Resolve conflicts in collaboration:
   - Collaborate with other developers by pulling their changes and resolving conflicts if any.
   - Use appropriate Git commands to fetch and merge remote changes.

Day 4: Git Workflow and Advanced Features

1. Explore Git workflow strategies:
   - Learn about popular Git workflows like Gitflow, GitHub Flow, or GitLab Flow.
   - Choose a workflow that suits your project's requirements.

2. Use Git tags:
   - Learn how to create lightweight and annotated tags to mark specific points in your project's history.
   - Understand the difference between tags and branches.

3. Explore Git log and history:
   - Use the `git log` command to view the commit history.
   - Learn about options like `--oneline`, `--graph`, and `--stat` to customize the log output.

- Understand the pricing structure and usage costs associated with different AWS services. Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security. AWS supports various MFA methods, such as virtual MFA devices and hardware tokens.
- Familiarize yourself with the AWS Free Tier, which provides limited access to certain services for new AWS accounts. Monitor your usage to stay within the free limits.
- Consider setting up billing alerts to receive notifications when your AWS usage exceeds a certain threshold.

Understanding Version Control: 

Version control is a system that tracks and manages changes to files over time. 
It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project simultaneously while keeping track of all changes made. 
Key benefits of using version control include: 
Easy collaboration and merging of changes 
Ability to revert to previous versions 
Tracking changes and attributing them to specific users 
Branching and parallel development
 
Introduction to GIT: 

GIT is a distributed version control system widely used in software development. 
It offers a lightweight and efficient way to manage projects of any size. 
Key components of GIT include: 
Repository: A collection of files and version history. 
Working directory: The current state of files on a local machine. 
Staging area: A temporary storage area to prepare files for commit. 
Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the repository. 

Installing GIT: 

Install GIT on your machine by following these steps: 
Go to the official GIT website (https://git-scm.com/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. 
Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation process. 
After installation, open a command prompt or terminal and verify the installation by running the command git --version. 
Basic GIT Commands:

Use the command git commit -m "Commit message" to commit the staged changes with an appropriate message. 

Viewing commit history: 

Use the command git log to view the commit history of a repository.
 
Undoing changes: 

Use the command git checkout <file(s)> to discard changes made to specific file(s). 
Use the command git reset HEAD <file(s)> to unstage changes.
